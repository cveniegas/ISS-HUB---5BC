            Orientation is required for all new first year and transfer students. The program is designed to help students make a successful transition from their previous college or high school to Sac State. During Orientation, student orientation leaders meet with small groups of new students to discuss academic requirements, advising tools and offer helpful tips regarding campus resources and student life.  In addition, new students meet with their major department advisors and register for courses. New fall students attend Orientation during the summer, while new spring students attend Orientation in January. Program details (including the Parent/Guest program) are located on the New Student Orientation website.
